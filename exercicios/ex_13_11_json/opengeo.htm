<p>
This server is used in the Python for Everybody
(<a href="https://www.py4e.com/">www.py4e.com</a>)
series of courses.  It is <b>highly</b> cached using CloudFlare
edge servers worldwide.  The student assignments retrieve a
fixed list of addresses so nearly every request will be fulfilled by the cache.
Each student adds <i>one</i> address to their list and that one will
miss the CloudFlare cache once.
</p>
<p>
If a request makes it past the CloudFlare cache, it will be delayed
by 5 seconds in this proxy before being forwarded to the actual server
in order not to trigger its rate limit.
This server also has its own rate limiting to keep users
from bypassing the CloudFlare cache and triggering the actual server's rate limit.
